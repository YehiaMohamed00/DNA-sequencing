# DNA-sequencing
Progamming approach in learning DNA sequencing and Alignment 

The aim of this educational project is to provide students with a practical tool to enhance their understanding of DNA string alignment and the various types of alignments, including consensus alignment, Smith-Wunsh, and global alignment. It also focuses on the utilization of scoring matrices like BLOSUM and PAM with customizable scoring parameters. Additionally, the project aims to familiarize students with position-specific scoring matrices. Its purpose is to facilitate hands-on learning and experimentation with these concepts in a user-friendly manner.
